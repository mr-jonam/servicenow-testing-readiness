## Start here

- [Decision guide](GUIDE.md): public-source context and original discussion questions.
- [Mini tool source / local page](docs/tool.html): workflow change conversation map.
- [Sources and retrieval limitations](docs/references.html).
- [Prepare a collaboration request](docs/contact.html): local copy/download, with a direct LinkedIn contact link.
- [Optional orientation skill](skills/servicenow-testing-readiness/SKILL.md).

Open `docs/index.html` in a browser or use the local preview:

```sh
npm run preview
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:4173](http://127.0.0.1:4173). No package installation is needed. Node.js 22 or later is used for the optional preview and configuration commands. The static pages also work from local files.

## What you can learn

- Separate platform automation discussion from end-to-end workflow acceptance.
- Consider requester, fulfiller and integration perspectives.
- Prepare a concise upgrade or change discussion brief.

The mini tool works in the browser without sign-up, cookies, analytics, external libraries, AI API calls or platform connections. Results reflect user selections or assumptions. Copying and text downloads are user initiated.

## From a useful question to a collaboration

1. Read the decision guide and official references.
2. Use the mini tool to identify what needs clarification.
3. Copy the questions you want to discuss and prepare a sanitised request.
4. [Send a short LinkedIn enquiry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manoj-rollo/) naming the guide, broad platform and decision ahead.

A first conversation can clarify the evidence question, its scope and whether a further engagement would be useful. Assessment, testing delivery or ongoing support can be scoped after that discussion; reading the guide does not promise an engagement or outcome. Never post client context or assessment requests in public issues.

## Scope

This repository contains orientation material, a small local discussion aid and an optional assistant skill. It supplies no implementation playbook, operational test suite, platform connector, internal delivery method, customer artefact or empirical assessment.
